# ArduinoYun-PhilipsHue
Control Philips Hue Lights with Arduino Yun, motion sensor and light sensor
I used a digital PIR and a light sensor to control the light of my room.
This sketch turn on light only when it detect motion and the room is too dark
The light stay on for 4 minutes than if no movement is detected it turns off
